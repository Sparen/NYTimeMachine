Welcome to the NYTimeMachine for HopHacks Spring 2016, made by Andrew Fan and John Amadeo!

This is a web-based application built with AngularJS and Bootstrap, that utilizes the New York Times API.

Our web interface prompts the user for a region of the globe and a year, and from that we will randomly select a newspaper article retrieved using the New York Times API to display. This article will be selected via a keyword determined via the region selected by the user, and may provide interesting perspectives on the past in regards to the United States and the rest of the world.
