# NYTimeMachine #

NYTimeMachine is a web app that allows users to get small glimpses of world events throughout time, viewed through the lens of the New York Times. https://limitless-earth-13104.herokuapp.com/

We hope this web app provides a fun way to discover more about a) world events during various points in history and b) how these events were covered by an American newspaper, the New York Times.

This project was created during HopHacks Spring 2016 by Andrew Fan and John Amadeo Daniswara!

NYTimeMachine was built with AngularJS and Bootstrap and utilizes the New York Times API.

Our UI prompts the user to select a region of the globe and a year, upon which a group of New York Times articles about that region during the selected year is randomly selected from the New York Times article database.
